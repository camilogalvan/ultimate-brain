## General Description
Is an exciting challenge where your knowledge and cunning lead you on the road to riches. 
Imagine being in the spotlight, under the bright spotlight, as you face a series of challenging questions.
Each question is like a rung on a ladder to fortune.
With each correct answer, you climb one step higher and get closer to the grand prize: 
one million units of in-game currency! But be careful, one wrong answer can cause you to fall and lose all your progress.
The tension builds as the questions become more difficult and time is against you.

The game was designed with the purpose of providing an entertaining and instructive experience to the users, and for this purpose an MVC (Model-View-Controller)
software architecture was implemented. In this architecture, the model is in charge of the data management and business logic of the game, 
while the view handles the presentation of the game and the user interaction. Finally, the controller is the component that receives user requests and
communicates with the model to obtain and update data. With this structure, players can enter the game with just their name and face a
series of increasingly difficult questions, with the opportunity to level up and win attractive prizes by answering correctly.
